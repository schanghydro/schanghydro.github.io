Hi! I'm Shuyu, a PhD candidate in Geography and NASA [FINESST](https://www.psu.edu/news/earth-and-mineral-sciences/story/geography-student-awarded-nasa-funding-study-harmful-algal-blooms) Graduate Research Fellow at the [Pennsylvania State University (PSU)](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Kimberly Van Meter](https://www.geog.psu.edu/directory/kimberly-van-meter). I am expected to graduate in Spring 2025. Before my PhD study, I obtained my MSE in Water Resources Engineering from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) and BS in Hydraulic and Hydropower Engineering with Highest Honours from the [China Agricultural University](https://en.cau.edu.cn/).

In my research, I strive to produce datasets and develop both process-based models and data-driven approaches to better quantify and enhance our understanding of the interactions and dynamics between hydrology and biogeochemistry, with the goal of supporting decision-making regarding water resources at various scales.



## News
[Oct 2024] My first-author manuscript, titled "Advancing Arctic River Temperature Predictions Using a Deep Learning Approach", is now available as a preprint at [[DOI: 10.22541/au.172745845.52823366/v1](https://doi.org/10.22541/au.172745845.52823366/v1)]

[Sep 2024] My first-author paper "The geometry of flow: Advancing predictions of river geometry with multi-model machine learning" was accepted to Water Resources Research. The preprint is available at [[arXiv: 2312.11476](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11476)]

[Jun 2024] I served as the science lead and co-organized with Dr. Kimberly Van Meter the [Chesapeake Water Summer Institute](https://www.psu.edu/news/earth-and-mineral-sciences/story/wetlands-water-quality-chesapeake-bay-focus-van-meter-nsf-career) at the Pennsylvania State University. This two-week summer institute has successfully concluded. Our students gave a talk at the Chesapeake Community Research Symposium '24, in Annapolis, MD. Thanks everyone!

[Hello World] Woo-hoo! Setting up my first personal website ðŸ¥³.
