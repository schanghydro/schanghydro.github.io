Hi! I'm Shuyu, a postdoc in the Department of Earth and Environment at Franklin & Marshall College.
Before joining F&M, I was a NASA [FINESST](https://www.psu.edu/news/earth-and-mineral-sciences/story/geography-student-awarded-nasa-funding-study-harmful-algal-blooms) Graduate Research Fellow and obtained my PhD in Geography from Penn State.
I obtained my MSE in Water Resources Engineering from Johns Hopkins University and BS in Hydraulic and Hydropower Engineering with Highest Honours from the China Agricultural University. Here is my [CV](https://schanghydro.github.io/files/chang-cv.pdf). 

**I will join the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Connecticut (UConn) in Fall 2026 as a tenure-track assistant professor.** Please stay tuned for more news!

In my research, I strive to produce datasets and develop both process-based models and data-driven approaches to better quantify and enhance our understanding of the interactions and dynamics between hydrology and biogeochemistry, with the goal of supporting decision-making regarding water resources at various scales.

## News
[Jul 2025] I joined the Department of Earth and Environment at Franklin & Marshall College as a postdoc scholar. Looking forward to the new chapters of research!

[Jun 2025] I defended my PhD Dissertation! ðŸŽ“

[May 2025] The work I led with my mentors, Kurt and Jon, during my Applied Machine Learning Internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory, was accepted by *Water Resources Research* and is now officially published at [[DOI: 10.1029/2024WR039053](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024WR039053)].
In this paper, we summarized the current gaps in Arctic river temperature predictions, presented a robust LSTM river temperature model without considering streamflow, and enhanced the interpretability of LSTM using Integrated Gradients.

[Feb 2025] I was awraded the AGU'24 Outstanding Student Presentation Award (OSPA).

[Feb 2025] I attended and delivered a talk in Chesapeake Bay AI/ML Workshop at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC).

[Feb 2025] I delivered a departimental seminar to the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Penn State.

[Jan 2025] I attended and presented at the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting in New Orleans for the first time. 

[Dec 2024] I went to AGU '24 in Washington DC. I gave an oral presentation and a poster presentation, met old friends, and made new connections! 

[Oct 2024] I visited Franklin & Marshall College and delivered a guest lecture on "Dam and Nutrients in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed" ðŸŽ“

[Oct 2024] My first-author paper "The geometry of flow: Advancing predictions of river geometry with multi-model machine learning", accepted to Water Resources Research, is now officially pressed at [[DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2023WR036733](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023WR036733)]

[Oct 2024] My first-author manuscript, titled "Advancing Arctic River Temperature Predictions Using a Deep Learning Approach", is now available as a preprint at [[DOI: 10.22541/au.172745845.52823366/v1](https://doi.org/10.22541/au.172745845.52823366/v1)]

[Jun 2024] I served as the science lead and co-organized with Dr. Kimberly Van Meter the [Chesapeake Water Summer Institute](https://www.psu.edu/news/earth-and-mineral-sciences/story/wetlands-water-quality-chesapeake-bay-focus-van-meter-nsf-career) at the Pennsylvania State University. This two-week summer institute has successfully concluded. Our students gave a talk at the Chesapeake Community Research Symposium '24, in Annapolis, MD. Thanks everyone!

[Hello World] Woo-hoo! Setting up my first personal website ðŸ¥³.
